> Optimize a site's performance, accessibility, and SEO

## Scenario

In this project, I worked as a freelance developer to optimize a site's SEO, performance, and accessibility.

My first task was to identify loading and SEO issues.

Next, I proposed recommendations to improve loading speed, code structure, and SEO.

I implemented the recommended improvements by modifying the site’s code. My goal was to enhance the site’s performance and accessibility for better search engine ranking. I used tools such as Lighthouse and Wave.

Finally, I created a report illustrating the results before and after the modifications. This report included screenshots of audits, explanations of the changes made, and their impact on the site's SEO and accessibility.

### Work done
