> Create a property rental agency website with ReactJS

## Scenario

In this project, I implemented the front-end of an application using React and React Router to create a modern and responsive user experience.

I worked on data presentation logic and React components, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

I used React Router to set up navigation between different pages of the application. This allowed me to understand how to efficiently manage routing in a modern web application.

The project focused exclusively on front-end development, based on provided mockups and using simulated data extracted from a JSON file.

I started the project with Create React App, a tool that simplifies the initial setup of a React application. I also used Node.js to run JavaScript code outside the browser. 

### Work done

- Developed a web interface with Sass
- Initialized an application with Create React App
- Configured navigation between application pages with React Router
- Developed web interface elements using React components
- Implemented CSS animations
