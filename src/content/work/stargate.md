## The project

> Development of an internal accounting tool!

The objective of this project was the in-house development of accounting software dedicated to UGC Group complexes.

### Participation in the Requirements Specification

I participated in the meetings to develop the requirements specification to ensure the needs related to the financial flow management of the group's cinemas were considered.

### Acceptance and Testing Phase

During the pre-deployment testing phase, UGC Group entrusted me with the testing phase.

My mission was to ensure the proper functioning of the tool and, if necessary, to precisely identify any issues encountered.

#### User Training

I was then tasked with training the users of the solution within the cinemas.
Conveying processes and best practices.
