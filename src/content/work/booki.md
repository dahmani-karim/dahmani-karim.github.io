> Create a travel agency's homepage with HTML & CSS

## Scenario

In this project, I created the homepage for a travel agency using HTML and CSS.

My main task was to integrate the responsive interface of their site. I had access to Figma mockups for mobile, tablet, and desktop, as well as the images and a summary note on the project specifications.

I created custom interface components using HTML and CSS to match the design mockups.

This gave me a deeper understanding of how code is structured and styled to meet design requirements.

Working on this project, I developed essential skills in responsive design, ensuring that the homepage functions well on all devices and screen sizes.

### Work done

- Integrated content according to a mockup using HTML and CSS
- Implemented a responsive interface with HTML and CSS
- Set up a front-end development environment
