## Le projet

> Modernization and harmonization of tools!

The objective of this project was to reduce the number of business tools by consolidating all data from various departments within the ERP Dynamics 365.

### Participation in the Requirements Specification

I participated in meetings to develop the requirements specification to ensure the needs related to customer service were considered.

### Acceptance and Testing Phase

During the pre-deployment testing phase, UP Group entrusted me with the testing phase for the customer service component.

My mission was to ensure the proper functioning of the ERP, the availability of necessary tools and data, and data compliance. 

#### User Training

I was then tasked with training the users of the solution within the customer service department.
Conveying processes and best practices.
